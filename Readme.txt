SyntaxBox (Fork)
===============================================================================

Overview
--------

SyntaxBox itself is a open source syntax editor control for the .NET Windows 
Forms toolkit. It's originally created by Roger Alsing and published under the 
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

This is a public fork of SyntaxBox with the following goals:
* support .NET Framework 3.5 and upwards
* ensure continuing maintenance
* add new features
* give every improvement back to the open source community
